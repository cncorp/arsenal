“…I need to tell you something.” “God, what now? You look—why are you shaking?” “I… I messed up.” “Spit it out.” “I… I slept with someone.” “…What?” “I’m sorry. It was a mistake. I—” “STOP. STOP TALKING. Are you serious?!” “I didn’t plan it—” “Oh my GOD. OH my GOD. I knew it. I KNEW something was off. I asked you. I asked you a thousand times!” “I’m sorry—” “DON’T SAY SORRY. DON’T YOU DARE. Sorry is NOTHING right now!” “I don’t know why it happened—” “YOU DID IT BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO. People don’t ‘accidentally’ fall into someone else’s bed!” “I was stupid. I was scared. I… I felt disconnected.” “SO YOU CHEATED?! THAT’S YOUR SOLUTION?!” “No—no, it’s not a solution, it was a mistake—” “YOU RUINED EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING.” “I know.” “NO YOU DON’T. You don’t know what you just did to me.” “…I’m so sorry.” “STOP CRYING. You don’t get to cry. You don’t get to fall apart right now.” “I didn’t mean to hurt you.” “You DID hurt me. You BROKE me.” “I know, I know, I’m sorry, please—” “DON’T TOUCH ME. Don’t come near me.” “…Okay.” “Oh my God… oh my God… I’m gonna throw up.” “Please let me explain—” “There is NOTHING to explain. You LIED. You BETRAYED me. You blew up our whole life.” “I regret it. I regret it so much—” “I DON’T CARE. I can’t believe you did this to us.” “I didn’t want to lose you.” “THEN WHY WOULD YOU DO THE ONE THING THAT LOSES ME?!” “I don’t know. I don’t know. I hate myself for it.” “Good. You should.” “…Please don’t say that.” “I don’t care how you feel right now. You didn’t care how I would feel, did you?” “I was scared.” “And now I’m DONE.” “Wait—what? What do you mean?” “I mean I’m done. I’m not staying with someone who cheats on me. I’m not.” “Please… please don’t say that. We can fix this—” “NO WE CAN’T. This isn’t fixable. This is DIVORCE.” “No—please, no, please—” “You should’ve thought about that before you opened your legs for someone else.” “Please don’t say that, it wasn’t like that—” “SHUT UP. I DON’T CARE. IT’S OVER.” “No—no, don’t leave, please, talk to me—” “There’s nothing left to say. I’m calling a lawyer.” “Oh my God—please, please, please don’t end it like this—” “You ended it. I’m just naming it.” “…I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…” “You should’ve been sorry BEFORE you cheated.” silence “…I can’t breathe.” “You’ll live.” “Please… please don’t go.” “I’m already gone.”
