"…okay, I don't want to start a fight, but we really need to talk about the yard again." "Is this about the dogs?" "Yes. It's about the dogs. And the poop. There's so much out there that I almost stepped in three piles just walking to the gate." "I picked some of it up yesterday." "Some. Not all. That's the problem." "I didn't realize it had to be all or nothing." "It's not 'all or nothing.' It's just… when it's left out there for days, it starts to smell. And then the neighbors give us that look. And then I feel embarrassed." "I wasn't trying to embarrass you." "I know. But it still ends up being me who deals with it." "That's not true. I picked up a bunch last week." "Yes, after I pointed it out three times." "I didn't hear you say it three times." "You heard me. You just… didn't respond. Or didn't do anything until I got upset." "I wasn't ignoring you. I just got busy." "I get busy too. And I still pick them up." "You're faster at noticing it. I don't even see it half the time." "You don't see literal piles of dog poop in the yard?" "…Not immediately." "That's part of the issue. You don't see it until it's unavoidable. And then I'm the one who feels responsible." "I'm not making you responsible." "But that's how it ends up. I walk outside, I smell it, I step around it, I get irritated, I feel alone in the responsibility." "I'm not trying to leave you alone with it. I'm just overwhelmed." "It's dog poop. It takes five minutes." "Yeah, but it's everything together. The dogs, the house, work, the dishes—" "Oh, perfect. Because the dishes are the other thing I needed to talk about." "…I figured." "Why are they sitting in the sink for two, sometimes three days?" "I wash them when I can." "You rinse them and leave them. That's not washing." "I'm soaking them." "For 72 hours?" "Some dishes need soaking." "No dish on Earth needs three days of soaking." "Okay, well I don't like being talked to like that." "And I don't like living in a kitchen that smells like old pasta water." "I'm doing my best." "No. You're doing the minimum until I get annoyed enough to finish it." "That's not fair." "It's what keeps happening." "You act like I don't contribute anything." "I didn't say that." "You implied it." "I said I need more consistency. That's different." "It doesn't feel different." "Look, when the sink is full, I feel overwhelmed and out of control. It makes me anxious. It makes the whole house feel chaotic." "I get overwhelmed too. That's why I sometimes leave the dishes." "And when you leave them, I feel like I have to deal with it." "I'm not leaving them for you. I'm leaving them because I run out of energy." "But then they sit there until I can't take it anymore, and then I'm the one who does them." "Maybe I'd get to them if you didn't jump in so fast and do it all." "Three days isn't 'jumping in fast.' That's me waiting, hoping you'll do it." "I'm sorry I'm not as fast as you want me to be." "It's not about speed. It's about living like we're both adults who share a home." "That hurts." "It hurts me too." "…Are you saying I'm not an adult?" "I'm saying I need partnership. Not reminders." "I don't want to be your child." "And I don't want to be your parent." "I'm trying. You know I'm trying." "Trying doesn't help if I can't feel it." "How do I make you feel it? Without you thinking I'm doing it too slowly?" "Do the thing before it becomes a problem. Not after." "I don't always know when it becomes a problem for you." "When the sink smells. When the yard smells. When things look like they've been sitting for days." "I feel judged when you say it like that." "I feel ignored." "…So what are we supposed to do then?" "I need you to pick up the poop more consistently. Like… every other day. Not once a week." "That feels like a lot." "I do it every other day. I'm not asking you to do more than me." "Okay… every other day. I can try that." "And the dishes… if you're too tired to wash them, at least rinse them properly. Or put them directly in the dishwasher. Not leave a pot full of water and a fork floating in it for 72 hours." "I didn't realize it bothered you this much." "I literally talk about it every time it happens." "I hear frustration. I don't hear the part where you're hurting." "It hurts. It makes me feel unnoticed. Like I'm carrying the load that we're supposed to share." "I'm not trying to make you carry it." "Intent isn't the same as impact." "…Okay." "And when I bring it up, I need you not to shut down." "I shut down because I feel like I can't get it right." "And I get louder because I feel like I'm doing it alone." "So we're in the cycle again." "Yeah." "You think I don't care. I think you're mad. Then we both freak out." "Yes." "…I don't want to freak out." "Me neither." "I can pick up the poop more often. And I can put the dishes in the dishwasher instead of the sink. I just need reminders sometimes." "I don't want to be your reminder system." "I know. I know. Just… maybe a nudge? Not a critique, just… a nudge." "I can nudge. But I can't chase." "Okay." "And you have to respond when I nudge. Not put it off for two days." "I can do that. Yes. I can." "Okay." "And in return… I'll try not to assume the worst when the dishes sit for a night." "That would help. A lot." "And maybe we can divide the chores clearly so we're not guessing whose turn it is." "Yeah. Let's write it down or something so we're not arguing about invisible expectations." "And if something is too much for you one day, tell me directly. Not by avoiding it." "I can do that. And if you need help, tell me before you get resentful." "Okay. That feels fair." "So… poop every other day. Dishes either washed or dishwasher-ed the same day. And we talk before things build up." "Yes." "Okay. I can work with that." "Me too." "Are we good?" "…Getting there." "Better than we were ten minutes ago." "True." "Okay. Want to go outside and pick up the yard together right now?" "Together?" "Yeah. Might as well start the new system today." "…Okay. That actually makes me feel better." "Me too." "Let's go."
