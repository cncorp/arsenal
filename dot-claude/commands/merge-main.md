Make sure that we have the most up to date version of main (git fetch). Then merge main into this branch.

If there are merge conflicts, you should review the commits that brought those changes in main so that you understand what the intent of that work was. You should also be aware of the context for the current branch.

Leverage your understanding of the two changes to inform the way that you decide to handle resolving merge conflicts. If you don't have high confidence in how to resolve a particular conflict, you can ask questions to the user to help figure it out.

Once you have resolved all the conflicts, commit the merge locally.
