description: Review engineering spec with feasibility, complexity, and risk analysis (project)
---

# Engineering Spec Review Command

**Purpose:** Add critical engineering review to specifications, validating feasibility, assessing complexity, and identifying risks.

**Workflow:** Run AFTER `/proposal-to-spec` creates specs in each directory.

## Usage

```bash
# Review a specific spec
/eng-spec-review user-retention-2025-11-18

# Search and review
/eng-spec-review "personalized check-ins"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find Specification

Search `docs/temp/specs/` for the spec file:
- If exact filename provided: `{topic}-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If search term provided: Find matching spec by content/title
- If multiple matches: Ask user to clarify

### Step 2: Read Specification

Read the spec to understand:
- **Overview:** What's being built
- **Requirements:** Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Architecture:** System design and components
- **API Changes:** New/modified endpoints
- **Database Changes:** Schema modifications
- **Implementation Plan:** Phased rollout approach
- **Testing Strategy:** Test coverage plans
- **Risks:** Already-identified risks
- **Rollout Plan:** Deployment strategy

### Step 3: Feasibility Analysis

**Question 1: Can we actually build this?**

Assess technical feasibility across multiple dimensions:

#### Technology Stack Feasibility

**Check if proposed technologies are viable:**
- Are the libraries/frameworks compatible with our stack?
- Do we have experience with these technologies?
- Are there known issues or limitations?
- Is the technology mature/production-ready?

**Use code search to verify:**
```bash
# Check if we're already using similar patterns
grep -r "similar_pattern" api/src/

# Check existing dependencies
cat api/pyproject.toml | grep -i "proposed_library"
```

**Feasibility indicators:**
- ✅ **High:** Uses existing stack, proven patterns, no new dependencies
- ⚠️ **Medium:** Requires new library but well-documented, team has similar experience
- ❌ **Low:** Requires unfamiliar tech, experimental libraries, significant learning curve

#### Infrastructure Feasibility

**Can our infrastructure support this?**
- Database capacity: Can Postgres handle the data volume?
- API throughput: Can we handle the request rate?
- Queue capacity: Can Redis handle the job volume?
- Storage: Do we have sufficient disk/memory?
- Network: Are external API rate limits acceptable?

**Check current capacity:**
```bash
# Example checks (conceptual)
# - Current database size and growth rate
# - Current API request volume
# - Current queue depth and processing rate
```

**Feasibility indicators:**
- ✅ **High:** Well within current capacity, no scaling needed
- ⚠️ **Medium:** Near capacity limits, may need optimization
- ❌ **Low:** Exceeds capacity, requires infrastructure scaling

#### Team Feasibility

**Do we have the skills to build this?**
- Does the team have experience with these technologies?
- Are there knowledge gaps that need training?
- Do we need to hire specialists?
- Can we learn what we need in reasonable time?

**Feasibility indicators:**
- ✅ **High:** Team has done this before, no skill gaps
- ⚠️ **Medium:** Team can learn with documentation, similar past experience
- ❌ **Low:** Requires expertise we don't have, steep learning curve

#### External Dependencies Feasibility

**Are external services reliable?**
- Review each external dependency mentioned in spec
- Check SLA, uptime history, rate limits
- Assess risk if service goes down
- Verify API stability and versioning

**For each external dependency:**
```markdown
**Service: {External Service Name}**
- SLA: {Uptime guarantee}
- Rate limits: {Requests/sec}
- Our usage: {Expected load}
- Risk: High/Medium/Low
- Mitigation: {Fallback strategy}
```

**Feasibility indicators:**
- ✅ **High:** Reliable services with generous limits, good SLAs
- ⚠️ **Medium:** Some concerns but mitigations exist
- ❌ **Low:** Unreliable services, tight rate limits, no fallbacks

#### Time Feasibility

**Can we build this in the estimated timeframe?**
- Review the effort estimate from spec
- Consider: tech complexity, unknowns, dependencies, team velocity
- Check if estimate is realistic

**Feasibility indicators:**
- ✅ **High:** Estimate matches complexity, similar past projects
- ⚠️ **Medium:** Tight but achievable with focus
- ❌ **Low:** Estimate way too optimistic, needs adjustment

**Show-stoppers:** {Any critical unmitigated risks, or "None"}
```

### Step 6: Effort Validation

**Does the effort estimate match the complexity?**

Compare spec's effort estimate with complexity analysis:

```markdown
**Effort Validation:**

**Spec Estimate:** {XS/S/M/L/XL from spec}
**Complexity Rating:** {Low/Medium/High/Very High}
**Feasibility Rating:** {High/Medium/Low}

**Recommended Effort:** {Updated estimate}

**Justification:**
- Complexity score: {X/20} suggests {Y weeks}
- Feasibility concerns add: {+Z days for unknowns}
- Risk mitigation adds: {+W days for safety}
- Total: {Final estimate}

**Confidence:** High/Medium/Low
```

### Step 7: Add Review to Spec

Append concise review (≤150 words) to the bottom of the spec file:

```markdown
{original spec content}

---

## ENGINEERING REVIEW ({YYYY-MM-DD})

**Feasibility:** High/Medium/Low - {1 sentence on key feasibility concern}

**Complexity:** Low/Medium/High/Very High ({X}/20) - {1 sentence on complexity drivers}

**Risk Level:** High/Medium/Low - {1 sentence on top risks}

**Effort Validation:** {Original estimate} → {Recommended estimate} - {1 sentence justification}

**Recommendation:** Approve/Approve with Conditions/Needs Revision/Reject
- {Key condition or concern, if any}

**Reviewer:** {Your name/AI}
```

**Keep it ≤150 words. Be specific and actionable.**
