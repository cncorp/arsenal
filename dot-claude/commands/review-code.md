# Code Review

Conduct a comprehensive code review of implemented features before handoff. This command performs both automated and manual review checks, ensuring code quality, architectural alignment, and maintainability standards are met.

## Instructions

### Purpose
- Perform thorough code review beyond automated checks
- Ensure architectural patterns are properly followed
- Validate business logic implementation
- Check for security, performance, and maintainability concerns
- Bridge the gap between implementation completion and specification handoff

### Prerequisites
- Implementation should be complete (via `/implement-tdd` or manual)
- All automated tests should be passing
- Basic quality checks (`just ruff`, `just lint`) should pass
- Research and implementation documents should exist

### Review Scope
This review goes beyond what automated tools catch:
- Business logic correctness
- Architectural pattern adherence
- Security best practices
- Performance implications
- Code maintainability
- Documentation completeness

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Context Gathering
- Load research document from `docs/specs/<topic>/RESEARCH.md`
- Load implementation plan if exists
- Identify all changed files using git diff
- Understand the intended architecture and patterns

### Phase 2: Automated Analysis
- Run comprehensive static analysis
- Check test coverage metrics
- Analyze code complexity
- Review dependency changes
- **SUBAGENT**: Invoke `task-complete-enforcer` if not already run

### Phase 3: Codex CLI Review
- **EXTERNAL AGENT**: Invoke Codex CLI for AI-assisted code review
  ```bash
  codex exec review
  ```
- Wait for Codex analysis to complete
- Parse Codex feedback for:
  - Code quality issues
  - Best practice violations
  - Potential bugs
  - Performance concerns
  - Security vulnerabilities
- Integrate Codex findings into review report
- Cross-reference Codex suggestions with manual review findings

### Phase 4: Manual Code Review
Execute systematic review of all changes:

#### Architecture Review
- Verify alignment with chosen architecture from research
- Check pattern consistency with existing codebase
- Validate abstraction levels
- Review module boundaries and dependencies

#### Business Logic Review
- Verify requirements are correctly implemented
- Check edge case handling
- Validate data flow and transformations
- Review error handling strategies

#### Security Review
- Check for injection vulnerabilities
- Review authentication/authorization logic
- Validate input sanitization
- Check for sensitive data exposure
- Review secret management

#### Performance Review
- Identify potential bottlenecks
- Check for N+1 queries
- Review caching strategies
- Validate resource cleanup
- Check for memory leaks

#### Test Review
- Verify test coverage adequacy
- Check test quality and assertions
- Review test data management
- Validate test isolation
- **SUBAGENT**: Re-invoke `pytest-test-reviewer` for test quality

### Phase 5: Documentation Review
- Check inline code documentation
- Verify API documentation completeness
- Review README updates
- Validate configuration documentation

### Phase 6: Feedback Consolidation
- Merge findings from all review phases
- Integrate Codex CLI recommendations
- Reconcile any conflicting feedback
- Prioritize issues by severity
- Generate comprehensive review report with findings
