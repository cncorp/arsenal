Please implement the next stage in the plan.  Keep the code concise and don't overengineer.

**After implementation:**
1. Use **test-runner skill** to validate (ruff → lint → test-all-mocked)
2. If tests fail, use **test-fixer skill** to iterate until passing
3. Mark stage as done in @CURRENT_SPEC.md once all tests pass

DO NOT COMMIT ANY CODE TO GIT OR RUN ANY GIT COMMANDS.
