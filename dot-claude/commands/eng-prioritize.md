description: Select best engineering spec, improve it, and distribute as FINAL_SPEC.md everywhere (project)
---

# Engineering Prioritize Command

**Purpose:** Review specs across multiple project directories, select the best one based on engineering criteria, improve it, and distribute a final version everywhere.

**Workflow:** Run AFTER `/eng-spec-review` adds engineering reviews to all specs.

## Usage

```bash
# Prioritize specs across multiple projects
/eng-prioritize ~/Hacking/codel/ct{5,6,7,8}/docs/temp/specs

# Prioritize specs in current project only
/eng-prioritize docs/temp/specs

# Filter by date
/eng-prioritize docs/temp/specs --date 2025-11-18
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Directories

Accept 1 or more directory paths:
- If relative paths: resolve from current working directory
- If absolute paths: use as-is
- Validate each directory exists

### Step 2: Discover Specs

For each directory:
```bash
# Find all spec markdown files
find {directory} -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md" -not -name "FINAL_SPEC.md"
```

List all specs found:
```
Found 5 specs:
- ct6/docs/temp/specs/user-retention-2025-11-18.md
- ct6/docs/temp/specs/onboarding-flow-2025-11-17.md
- ct5/docs/temp/specs/user-retention-2025-11-18.md
- ct7/docs/temp/specs/user-retention-2025-11-18.md
- ct8/docs/temp/specs/message-templates-2025-11-15.md
```

### Step 3: Review Each Spec

For each spec, extract and analyze:

**1. Core content:**
- Overview and problem statement
- Requirements (functional and non-functional)
- Architecture design
- API and database changes
- Implementation plan
- Testing strategy
- Risk assessment
- Rollout plan
- Priority (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Effort estimate (XS/S/M/L/XL)

**2. Engineering Review (if present):**
- Feasibility (High/Medium/Low)
- Complexity (Low/Medium/High/Very High with X/20 score)
- Risk Level (High/Medium/Low)
- Effort Validation
- Recommendation

**3. Score the spec:**

```
Score = (Feasibility × 4) + (Simplicity × 3) + (Safety × 3)

Feasibility (from review):
- High = 4 points
- Medium = 3 points
- Low = 2 points
- No review = 2 points (assume medium)

Simplicity (inverse of complexity):
- Low complexity (5-8/20) = 4 points
- Medium complexity (9-12/20) = 3 points
- High complexity (13-16/20) = 2 points
- Very high complexity (17-20/20) = 1 point
- No review = 2 points (assume medium)

Safety (inverse of risk):
- Low risk = 4 points
- Medium risk = 3 points
- High risk = 2 points
- No review = 2 points (assume medium)

Max score: 11/10 (4+4+3 when adjusted for priority)
```

**Priority bonus:**
- P0: +1 point to final score
- P1: +0 points
- P2: -1 point
- P3: -2 points

### Step 4: Select Best Spec

Rank specs by score (highest first):

```
1. ct6/user-retention-2025-11-18.md - Score: 11/10
   Feasibility: High (4), Simplicity: Medium (3), Safety: High (4), Priority: P0 (+1)

2. ct7/user-retention-2025-11-18.md - Score: 10/10
   Feasibility: High (4), Simplicity: Medium (3), Safety: High (4), Priority: P1 (+0)

3. ct5/onboarding-flow-2025-11-17.md - Score: 8/10
   Feasibility: Medium (3), Simplicity: High (4), Safety: Medium (3), Priority: P1 (+0)
```

Select the highest-scoring spec as the **base**.

**Tie-breaking rules:**
If multiple specs have the same score:
1. Prefer higher feasibility (more likely to succeed)
2. Prefer lower complexity (easier to implement)
3. Prefer lower risk (safer deployment)
4. Prefer more recent date (latest thinking)
5. Prefer spec with engineering review (validated)

### Step 5: Improve the Best Spec

Take the best spec and enhance it by addressing weaknesses:

#### 5.1: Address Feasibility Concerns

**If feasibility is Medium or Low:**
- Review feasibility assessment from engineering review
- Identify blocking issues
- Add mitigation strategies
- Consider alternative approaches
- Update architecture to address concerns

**Example improvements:**
```markdown
## FEASIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS

**Original concern:** Team lacks experience with Redis Streams
**Improvement:**
- Phase 1: Use simpler Redis lists first (team knows this)
- Phase 2: Migrate to Streams after proof-of-concept (2 weeks learning)
- Fallback: Stick with lists if Streams prove difficult

**Original concern:** External API rate limits too restrictive
**Improvement:**
- Add request batching (10 requests → 1 batch)
- Implement caching layer (reduces calls by 70%)
- Add fallback to degraded mode if rate limited
```

#### 5.2: Reduce Complexity

**If complexity is High or Very High:**
- Simplify the architecture
- Break into smaller phases
- Remove non-essential features from MVP
- Use simpler technologies
- Reduce number of integrations

**Example improvements:**
```markdown
## COMPLEXITY REDUCTIONS

**Original plan:** 5 new tables with complex relationships
**Simplified:**
- Phase 1: 2 core tables only
- Phase 2: Add 3 additional tables after core stabilizes
- Reduces initial complexity from 15/20 → 9/20

**Original plan:** Integrate 4 external services simultaneously
**Simplified:**
- Phase 1: Integrate 1 critical service only
- Phase 2: Add remaining services incrementally
- Reduces integration complexity, easier debugging
```

#### 5.3: Mitigate Risks

**If risk level is High or Medium:**
- Add mitigation strategies for top risks
- Implement circuit breakers
- Add comprehensive monitoring
- Create detailed rollback plan
- Add safety mechanisms

**Example improvements:**
```markdown
## RISK MITIGATIONS ADDED

**Risk:** Database migration could corrupt data
**Mitigation:**
- Add dry-run mode to test migration on copy of production DB
- Implement migration in reversible steps
- Add data validation after each step
- Maintain backup for 30 days

**Risk:** New cron jobs conflict with existing schedules
**Mitigation:**
- Use distributed locks (Redis) to prevent double-execution
- Stagger execution times (15-minute offset from existing jobs)
- Add monitoring for job conflicts
- Implement graceful degradation if lock acquisition fails
```

#### 5.4: Validate Effort Estimate

**Review the effort estimate:**
- Compare with complexity score
- Check against feasibility concerns
- Factor in risks and mitigations
- Adjust if improvements changed scope

**Effort calibration:**
- Very High complexity (17-20) + Low feasibility = XL (1+ month)
- High complexity (13-16) + Medium feasibility = L (2-4 weeks)
- Medium complexity (9-12) + High feasibility = M (1-2 weeks)
- Low complexity (5-8) + High feasibility = S (3-5 days)

Update effort if needed based on improvements.

#### 5.5: Synthesize from Other Specs

**If multiple specs address the same feature:**
- Compare approaches across specs
- Take best technical solutions from each
- Merge unique insights
- Combine risk mitigations
- Select most robust architecture

**Example synthesis:**
```markdown
## SYNTHESIS FROM MULTIPLE SPECS

**Best approach from ct6:** Redis-based queue for job distribution
**Best approach from ct7:** Distributed lock mechanism
**Best approach from ct5:** Comprehensive monitoring setup

**Combined approach:** Use ct7's lock mechanism + ct6's queue + ct5's monitoring
```

### Step 6: Create FINAL_SPEC.md

Format:

```markdown
# FINAL ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION: {Feature Name}

Improving best spec...

Addressing feasibility concerns:
✓ No major concerns (already High)

Reducing complexity:
✓ Breaking cron job implementation into 2 phases:
  - Phase 1: Manual trigger only (simpler, faster)
